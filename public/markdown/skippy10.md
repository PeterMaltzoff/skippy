# Design
For 1.0 I want to try a iterative approach.

The first step is to take the high level task and break it into a tree of mid level tasks. These will be first order estimates of what is needed to be done.

## Mid level tasks
Each mid level task will be connected between each other with a type of flow chart. 
- You can include mid level tasks that simply perform actions
- You can have mid level tasks that can check if a condition is met and choose which task to perform next.
- You can have mid level tasks that can aquire information and update the vector database.

Mid level tasks can update the mid level tasks in the tree.
